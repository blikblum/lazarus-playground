IDE addon for showing a search box of all IDE commands.
It works like the command palette in Atom or Visual Studio Code.

It can be invoked using the key combination
Meta-Alt-P on MacOS
Shift-Alt-P on all other platforms.

Start typing, and the available commands will be filtered.
If you type multiple words, all words must match.

The list of recent files/packages/projects is also searchable. Using the
enter key will open the selected file.

The list of installed components is also searchable. Using the enter key
will drop the selected component on the currently designed form (if any is
active) or will select it on the component palette. This is configurable.

The key combination can be configured in the key options, search for
scout.

You can set
* the color of the matches,
* color of shortcut key (and whether it should be shown at all)
in the IDE options.
* What to search (commands/recent items/components)
